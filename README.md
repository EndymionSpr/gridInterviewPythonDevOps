# Interview Question
Simple python script to read lines from file and print chosen colums based on first column value.

I don't remember exact question and i lost it after closing Zoom meeting but i think i got everything but numbers right.

I later added bash version. It returns same values but in separate strings and not array with brackets and apostrophes (makes more sense for bash scripting imo).
